# Snakes and Ladders Kata

Platform agnostic solution for the Snakes and Ladders kata coded in net6.0.

By Antonio Martinez Guerrero, 2023.

## Features

- Token Can Move Across the Board
- Player Can Win the Game
- Moves Are Determined By Dice Rolls

## Run the app

You can run the console application to try the solution running the command:

```
 > dotnet run
```

You willl be asked for entering the number of players for the game. Then a new game will start using a board with 100 squares and a regular dice with 6 sides.
No snakes or ladders were added since they were not required so far in the user stories.

You can run the tests just running the command:

```
 > dotnet test
```
